# Rust Basics

Several mini rust projects for learning the fundamentals of the language. Made while working through links 2 and 3, see /docs for my notes. 

### A crucial remark

This IS NOT a rust project, simply a collection of notes and mini-projects I've made while learning rust. It is designed as a reference for myself (and perhaps others, though one should learn actively not passively...) and as such I am not going to be following large-scale rust project conventions, even if this ends up containing a reasonable amount of code. Each non docs/ directory in the root should correspond to one set of notes (with matching names), though I may not always stick to this either.
