# Rust Basics

Several mini rust projects for learning the fundamentals of the language. Made while working through links 2 and 3, see /docs for my notes. I have omitted certain details when they are trivial (to me). Some things in these notes may be trivial to you, whereas some things I omitted (or at the very least didn't explain) may not be. This is why you should create your own notes. Alas, they're probably somewhat useful if you want something marginally quicker than flicking through the rust book.

### A crucial remark

This IS NOT a rust project, simply a collection of notes and mini-projects I've made while learning rust. It is designed as a reference for myself (and perhaps others, though making your own is almost certainly better) and as such I am not going to be following any large-scale rust project conventions, even if this ends up containing a reasonable amount of code.
